[![Crate](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/cdb3.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/cdb3)

This library provides pure Rust support for reading and writing
[CDB][cdb] files.  A CDB file is a constant key-value on-disk hash
table, designed for high-speed lookups.

This is a **fork** of the (cdb2-rs)[https://crates.io/crates/cdb2] crate.
